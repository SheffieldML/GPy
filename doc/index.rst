`GPy <http://sheffieldml.github.io/GPy/>`_ is a Gaussian Process (GP) framework written in Python, from the Sheffield machine learning group.

The `GPy homepage <http://sheffieldml.github.io/GPy/>`_ contains tutorials for users and further information on the project, including installation instructions.
This documentation is mostly aimed at developers interacting closely with the code-base.
