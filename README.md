Compiling documentation:
========================

The documentation is stored in doc/ and is compiled with the Sphinx Python documentation generator, and is written in the reStructuredText format.

The Sphinx documentation is available here: http://sphinx-doc.org/latest/contents.html


Installing dependencies:
------------------------

To compile the documentation, first ensure that Sphinx is installed. On Debian-based systems, this can be achieved as follows:

    sudo apt-get install python-pip
    sudo pip install sphinx

A LaTeX distribution is also required to compile the equations. Note that the extra packages are necessary to install the unicode packages. To compile the equations to PNG format for use in HTML pages, the package *dvipng* must be installed. IPython is also required. On Debian-based systems, this can be achieved as follows:

    sudo apt-get install texlive texlive-latex-extra texlive-base texlive-recommended
    sudo apt-get install dvipng
    sudo apt-get install ipython


Compiling documentation:
------------------------

The documentation can be compiled as follows:

    cd doc
    make html

The HTML files are then stored in doc/_build/


Running unit tests:
===================

Ensure nose is installed via pip:

    pip install nose

Run nosetests from the root directory of the repository:

    nosetests -v
